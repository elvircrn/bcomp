## The stack frame
The stack frame, also known as activation record is the collection of all data on the stack associated with one subprogram call.

The stack frame generally includes the following components:

* The return address
* Argument variables passed on the stack
* Local variables (in HLLs)
* Saved copies of any registers modified by the subprogram that need to be restored (e.g. $s0 - $s8 in MAL).
